Looks great  with light and dark color schemes. Shown here with ![Arc](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde) and ![Arc-Dark](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde) color schemes.

| Feature | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| Titlebars can use the color supplied by your system's color scheme... | ![](regularcolors.png?raw=true) |
| ...or match the window color of your color scheme... | ![](colormatching.png?raw=true) |
| ...or manually use a custom color picker to paint the titlebar and perfectly match even GTK applications! | ![](perfectcolor.png?raw=true) |
| Shadows and highlight lines make sure you don't lose track of your windows in low contrast environments. | ![](low_contrast.png?raw=true) |
| Embrace flat design, or use gradients and a titlebar separator; your choice! BreezewayMod will use your chosen color profile to bring you a smooth interface that fits _your_ desktop. |  ![](gradients.png?raw=true) |
| A nice, clean settings page gives you granular control over the theme's features. | ![](settings.gif?raw=true) |
| Take customization to the next level with window specific settings, enabling you to mix and match settings and colors just the way you like it. | ![](window_settings.png?raw=true) |
| Support for HiDPI screens comes out of the box as well. Just increase size of titlebar, buttons and border radius and you're all set. | ![](hidpi.png?raw=true)
| Hovering over window buttons reveals additional icons. You can choose to also always show the icons. | ![](buttonicons.png?raw=true) |
